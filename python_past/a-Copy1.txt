In Section 12.1, we will learn how to read from a text ﬁle. For now, here’s a line of code that reads the entire contents of a ﬁle containing the text of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and stores the contents in a string called text: text = open('romeoandjuliet.txt').read() To get at the individual words, we will use the split method to turn the string into a list of its individual words. Also, because some words may be capitalized, we will convert the whole string to lowercase. We also have to remove punctuation. from string import punctuation
text = text.lower() for p in punctuation: text = text.replace(p, '') words = text.split()
Nextcomesthedictionarycodethatdoesthecounting. Thedictionarykeyswillbethewordsfrom the text and the values will be counts of how many time each word appears. We start with an empty dictionary. Then for every word in the list of words, if we have seen the word before, we add one to its count, and otherwise we set the count for that word equal to 1. Here is the code: d = {} for w in words: if w in d: d[w] = d[w] + 1
